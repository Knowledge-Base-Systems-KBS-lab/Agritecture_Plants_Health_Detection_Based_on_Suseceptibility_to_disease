# Agritecture_Plants_Health_Detection_Based_on_Suseceptibility_to_disease
Detection of plant health based on Healthy, Resistant, Susceptible Classes in Agriculture Sector
Identifying the health of plants in agriculture secter is a lengthy but necessary process to predict which conditions are sutiable for plants health. and how can susatable plats be safed from disease. The issue is especially intensified in regions with expansive farming land and crop growth. Rather than manual identification, neural networks can be used to identify plants that are healthy or diseased.

This repository contains the code for neural networks which are used to identify plant diseases.

and a small small dataset of healthy and susaptable plants.
